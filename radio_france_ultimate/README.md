# radio-france-ultimate
Add keyboard shortcuts for almost all keys on the Radio France player(s).

The shortcuts are:

Left arrow -> -10s

Space -> Pause

Right arrow -> +10s

Up arrow -> Increase volume

Down arrow -> Decrease volume

Should work for every radio, except "Mouv'" that, for now, has some malfunctionning buttons.
