- Here you can see that I wasted 1 minute on reddit, and can still spend 15-1 = 14 minutes on it
- Once you wasted enough time on a website, the page will be replaced every minute by a dull "Keep Working" message

- PS: The "Points" is a gamification feature that isn't fully fleshed out yet, for now it's just the number of days since the installation. It's a reward for using a productivity plugin (yay!)
## Adding a new rule
- Type your website in the left field, the time in minutes in the right field, then click the + sign. The new rule will be added

## About notifications warning
- **When there are less than 3 minutes left on a root domain, you will get a huge pop up in your current tab that will slowly move on your screen**
- **It is intentionnally intrusive. This is to inform you that, if you have unsaved "work" in your current tab, you need to save it ASAP before the page is ruthlessly destroyed**
- Click on it to dimiss it
